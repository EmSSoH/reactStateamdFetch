General part.

a single page aplication is an aplication where only a single HTML page is used, 
and is dynamically updated via scipts when the user intereacts with the page.

these scripts are run client side which in turn frees up server side recources when constant calls is not coming in to the server
from every user on the site. making it a popular choice for development of modern web aplications.


you can use use props to pass data on to components and use states to then reload the scripts to include the new data that has been passed on.

with data that has been passed on or maybe fetched javascript array method like map, filter and reduce can be used to take the information
and dynamicly structure it in table, ul's etc. in the case of and array of information it can be mapped into a new array but where each point of data
has got the html surounding it to put it into a table.
